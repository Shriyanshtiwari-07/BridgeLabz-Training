/*

Create a program to find the bonus of 10 employees based on their years of service as well as the total bonus amount the 10-year-old company Zara has to pay as a bonus, along with the old and new salary.
Hint => 
Zara decides to give a bonus of 5% to employees whose year of service is more than 5 years or 2% if less than 5 years
Create a Method to determine the Salary and years of service and return the same. Use the Math.random() method to determine the 5-digit salary for each employee and also use the random method to determine the years of service. Define 2D Array to save the salary and years of service.
Write a Method to calculate the new salary and bonus based on the logic defined above and return the new 2D Array of the latest salary and bonus amount 
Write a Method to Calculate the sum of the Old Salary, the Sum of the New Salary, and the Total Bonus Amount and display it in a Tabular Format
